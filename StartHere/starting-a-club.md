### Find the Perfect Venue

Get to know your local community by reaching out to local business owners and organizations. You might try:

#### an Independent Cafe

Buy your event snacks and drinks (or have participants buy their own) at a local cafe in exchange for a reserved space. Read about Mozillian <a href="http://www.mozraj.com/2013/10/cyber-cafe-internet-cafe-for-marketing.html">Gauthamraj's experiences</a> in Cyber Caf√©s! 

#### the Local Library

Libraries are community hubs, and librarians are usually enthused about having digital literacy events take place in their spaces. Just take a look at <a href="http://mozillarian.org/2014/01/09/librarians-in-the-digital-age-infographic/">this infographic</a>!

#### a Hackerspace

Be sure you reserve a comfortable venue where you can move the chairs and sit together in a circle. Ensure there is Internet, power and good lighting. Nearby Hackerspaces are usually perfect for events.

#### a Museum

Plan to tie in topics relevant to the museum, then speak with the museum director about your event. Ask the museum if they'll require an admission fee.

### Think about Recruitment

Personally invite as many learners as possible to your club and use your networks to get the word out. There are as many ways to code and learn and teach the Web as there are people. Remember also to recruit a number of facilitators proportionate to the number of learners you anticipate attending club. We like a ratio of 1:8 or 1:12 facilitators to learners, but if people are engaged with the work - and you are super prepared - you can sometimes get away with something more like 1:20.

Advertise your event far and wide. Use the [Webmaker Events](https://events.webmaker.org/) platform to tell the world what you're going to do. It allows people to sign up and you to show the world who's mentoring, and what's going to happen.

### Plan to share the work and host celebrations

Every so often, invite community members to join your club for a day or two, and build some Demo or Expo Fairs into your club's schedule. Keep a blog that documents the club's day-to-day work, as well as its special events. Invite learners to create blogs of their own. You can also use the [Webmaker Events](https://events.webmaker.org/) platform to share photos of what happened!

### Plan for stability and sustainability

What does your club need to continuing operating without you? With a dozen more participants? If you lose your space? What happens when the Internet goes down? How will people know if you've cancelled tonight's session of club? You don't have to answer every question all at once, but in offering your club you're entering into a social contract with your community. Build a support network for yourself to help cover facilitator absences or sudden changes in circumstance. Set up a fall-back location. Canvas for volunteers in case of cancellation. See if you can partner with a school or non-profit that can handle your need for space - and/or transportation - at minimal or no cost to your club. Have an idea of what you'll do on the day everything goes wrong. Once you and your club make it through that day, everything else will seem like a breeze.
