#Web Literacy Basics (6 sessions)

In this module, learners begin to learn about what makes the web a unique place to find and gather information. Together, we'll begin collecting content we would like to build a webby project around. This will help learners determine their story and purpose for a web project. This module uses pre-existing webpages to help learners use remixing to make something new. It teaches basic HTML/CSS while helping learners understand that the web was built for remixing. This module also helps learners put their ideas online by focusing on the basic technologies that make the Web run (HTML/CSS). 

If your club has done ideation or planning modules, you can use participants pre-existing content to help them build their ideas for the web. Otherwise, use the activities to help learners understand the basic concepts of composing for the web, HTML and CSS.

##Learning Objectives and Assessment

By the end of this module, learners should be able to: 

* access the web using the common features of web browsers
* use hyperlinks to access a range of resources on the web
* manage information from various sources on the web
* locate or find desired information within search results
* research the authorship and ownership of websites and their content.
* identify and use HTML tags
* structure a web page
* create something new on the Web using existing resources
* use CSS tags to change the style and layout of a Web page
* improve the accessibility of a Web page by modifying its color scheme and markup

Learners should also be aware that:

* remixing is a form of derivative artwork.
* media has influence over culture and society, and cultures and societies have influence over shaping media.
* the Web is made out of building blocks that they can rearrange to create new things through an iterative process.
