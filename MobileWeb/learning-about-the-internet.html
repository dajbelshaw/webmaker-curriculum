                            <h3>Preparation</h3>
                            <p>The Internet is the giant public network that we connect to with mobile phones, computers, tablets or other devices, and find webpages such as <a href="https://facebook.com">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://google.com">Google</a> and <a href="http://www.bdjobs.com/">Bdjobs</a>. When we talk about the <b>Web</b>, we mean the interconnected system through which we navigate the Internet. You might have heard of the "<b>mobile internet</b>". This term refers to using the Internet with a wireless device &mdash; any device that does not need a cable to access the Internet. Apps (otherwise known as applications) are functions on wireless devices that give us direct access to platforms like Facebook, Viber and Webmaker.</p>

                            <p>In this session we will learn about the Internet and how it can be used to access information conveniently, quickly and accurately.</p>

                            <p>This activity is designed for people who have limited or no experience with the Internet. If learners are familiar with the iIternet as a concept you can skip <a href="setting-up-your-phone.html">a more relevant activity</a>.</p>

                            <h3>Icebreaker: Zip Zap Zop!</h3>

                            <p>Ask all of the learners to stand in a circle. Have everyone in the group repeat the words "<b>Zip, Zap, Zop</b>" several times, all together so that the pattern of the words becomes familiar.</p>

                            <p>In the circle, explain that you have an imaginary bolt of energy in your hands, and you can send it to anyone in the circle by pointing it at them. You do this by looking someone in the eye, pointing your hands in a forward-pointing prayer position at them, and saying "<b>zip</b>". Then, they have the bolt and can pass it on to someone else in the circle by saying "<b>zap</b>" with the same eye contact and hand motions. That person then uses "<b>zop</b>" – and so on, in the <b>zip</b>, <b>zap</b>, <b>zop</b> pattern. When someone falters, simply have them start again with "zip".</p>

                            <h3>Role-playing device functions</h3>

                            <p>Have a mentor stick <a href="../assets/webmaker-mobile-curriculum-handout.pdf">pictures</a> of a basic phone, a smartphone and a computer at the front of the class.</p>

                            <p>Then, without speaking, the mentor acts out the various actions listed below in a light-hearted manner. The learners have to watch and guess what the action is – if it is too hard to guess, the mentors might offer a word or two as a hint. Once the class have guessed correctly, as a group they tell the mentor which device(s) they can perform this activity on, and the mentor writes the activity under the corresponding device.</p>

                                <p>If there is more than one mentor to assist the facilitator, have them take turns acting out the actions.</p>

                            <h3>Adventures with smartphones</h3>

                            <p>Arrange the participants in pairs, and ask them to imagine they have a smartphone (with 3G) in their pocket. Give each pair one of the scenarios from below, and ask them to brainstorm and write out the different actions they could take with their smartphone.</p>

                            <p>You and your dad LOVE cricket, and Bangladesh is playing India at the stadium tonight. He sends you an SMS while you are at work, telling you he has two tickets for the match – but he is not sure the best route to the cricket grounds, and he thinks it may be called off because of the rain – he wonders whether if it is worth the effort. What can you do to convince him you should go together?</p>
