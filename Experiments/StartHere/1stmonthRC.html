            <h1>Your First Months as a Regional Coordinator</h1>

            <p class="lead"><strong>A regional coordinator is a central role</strong> serving a global community of Mozillians dedicated to teaching the web. We are gracious conveners and authentic learners. <strong>Our goal is to support Mozilla Club captains to teach the web in a locally relevant and sustained way.</strong></p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <h3>Preamble</h3>

        <p>We are in service to club captains becoming better champions and facilitators of web literacy. Our roles will be <strong>full of reflection and experimentation</strong>. A Regional Coordinator is *not* running lots of clubs. Instead, you are <strong>recruiting, on-boarding, and sustaining club captains</strong> to achieve positive outcomes, a sense of community and purpose, and to further web literacy. Regional coordinators become part of a community of practice with other local leaders around the world.</p>

        <p><strong>Our club captains' success is our success.</strong></p>

        <h3>Outcomes</h3>

        <p>After completing the on-boarding outlined here, youâ€™ll have:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A community of peers helping you realize your vision and learn with you.</li>

            <li>Club captains ready to lead learning groups under your mentorship.</li>

            <li>Your personal story for how you empower club captains in your region.</li>
        </ul>

					<p><strong>Introduce yourself to your peers.</strong> Share your story with fellow regional coordinators. Discuss how you want to learn and how your peers can best support you. <a href="http://discourse.webmaker.org/category/clubs">Give feedback and encouragement to others.</a></p>

                    <p><strong>Have a conversation with each potential club captain.</strong> Talking to someone 1:1 is very powerful. Tell them your story and how they can make a difference. Invite them to run a club. Also, listen to what they want to achieve and take their insights back into your planning. </p>
